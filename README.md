This project is divided into 2 parts, first part is the basic data visualization, introducing and comparing two of the libraries that i learnt, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Second part is an extension of the first part, doing a Mercedes Benz car price prediction. It is divided into 3 parts, data cleaning , EDA and prediction. For the prediction part,
I have used linear regression and random forest regression to predict car price and compare their performance.

Thank you.
